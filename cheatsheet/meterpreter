ps ;; generally most stable processes are explorer.exe, service.exe or spoolsv.exe
;; Prior to further action, we need to move to a process that actually
;; has the permissions that we need to interact with the lsass service,
;; the service responsible for authentication within Windows.
;; In order to interact with lsass we need to be 'living in' a process that
;; is the same architecture as the lsass service (x64 in the case of this
;; machine) and a process that has the same permissions as lsass.
