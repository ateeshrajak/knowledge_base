# Pentest AJP
# Default Port: 8009

;; AJP is a wire protocol. Its an optimized version of the HTTP
;; protocol to allow a standalone web server such as Apache to talk to
;; Tomcat. Historically, Apache has been much faster than Tomcat at serving
;; static content. The idea is to let Apache serve the static content when
;; possible, but proxy the request to Tomcat for Tomcat related contents.
