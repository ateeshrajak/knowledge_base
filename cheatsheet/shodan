# shodan
# one of the most important command is "download"
# by default it will give us 1000 results by default
# but we can bypass the limit by doing: 
# --limit -1 
# So if you often search for the same queries it will help you save credits.
# The export credits are used to download data from the website at the
# rate of: 1 export credit lets you download up to 10,000 results.
