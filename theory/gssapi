# GSSAPI
# Generic Security Services Application Program Interface

This is an interface with for programs to access security services. 

Basically GSSAPI defines a set of functions that can be used by developers
to use the security services.
Basically the developer does not need to know the internals of a security
service if she/he uses the GSSAPI interface.


In fact, the GSSAPI, by itself, does not provide any security. Instead,
security-service vendors provide GSSAPI implementations - usually in the
form of libraries installed with their security software. These libraries
present a GSSAPI-compatible interface to application writers who can
write their application to use only the vendor-independent GSSAPI. If
the security implementation ever needs replacing, the application need
not be rewritten.

There are different implementations and one of the most famous commonly
used is the GSSAPI Kerberos implementation.


The GSSAPI is standardized for the C (RFC 2744) language. Java implements
the GSSAPI as JGSS, the Java Generic Security Services Application
Program Interface.

Some Limitation of GSSAPI are:

- standardizing only authentication, rather not authorization too;
- assuming a clientâ€“server architecture;

Anticipating new security mechanisms, the GSSAPI includes a
negotiating pseudo mechanism, called SPNEGO, that can discover and
use new mechanisms not present when the original application
was built.
