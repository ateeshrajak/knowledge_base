# Pentesting Ident (port 113)

# Nmap ident enumeration
auth-owners.nse : Attempts to find the owner of an open TCP port by querying an auth daemon which must also be open on the target system.
nmap --script=auth-owners.nse <targetIP>


If the port ident 113 is open, it might be a good idea to try pentest
monkey ident-user-enum Perl Script. The same result is also achieved by:

perl ident-user-enum.pl 10.10.xx.xx 22 53 111 113 512 513 514 515
