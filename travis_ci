# Travis CI

NOTE: As of 2020 there are two travis-ci, one is travis-ci.org
whose end is planned to be on the end of 2020 and travis-ci.com.
To add a repository to travis-ci.com we should first enable
https://travis-ci.com/account/repositories
and click on "Manage Repositories"
at this point from github we should select the repositories we
want to run within travis-ci.

To go to a specific travis CI page corresponding to a github repo
we can go to the URL:
https://travis-ci.com/github/<githubuser>/<repo_name>

Once our account is activated we should also go to the project
settings in travis CI to set the github token.

Settings on Travis CI are generally found at:
https://travis-ci.com/<user_name>/<repo_name>/settings

We'll use the variable name RELEASE_TOKEN. To get our value, we need to go
to GitHub and add a new token, here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
This will need to just have Repo scope, and doesn't require anything
further. Copy the key provided into the "VALUE" field in Travis. Make
sure you keep "DISPLAY VALUE IN BUILD LOG" unticked to keep the value
out of your logs, and thus not visible to anyone else.

## Example CI for cross-platform deployment

I found this travis-CI settings quite useful to have a cross-platform
deployment whenever a new tag is pushed, and tests running for each
pushed commit.

I generally have the classic ".travis.yml" and an additional
".travis/" directory which contains installation and deployment
scripts for building standalone executables.

```travis-ci
language: python # this works for Linux but is an error on macOS or Windows
matrix:
  include:
    - name: "Python on Linux"
      python: 3.8           
    - name: "Python 3.7 on macOS"
      os: osx
      osx_image: xcode11    # Python 3.7.2 running on macOS 10.14.3
      language: shell       # 'language: python' is an error on Travis CI macOS
      # python: 3.7         # 'python:' is ignored on Travis CI macOS
      before_install: python3 --version ; pip3 --version ; sw_vers
    - name: "Python 3.7 on Windows"
      os: windows           # Windows 10.0.17134 N/A Build 17134
      language: shell       # 'language: python' is an error on Travis CI Windows
      # python: 3.7         # 'python:' is ignored on Travis CI Windows
      env:  PATH=/c/Python37:/c/Python37/Scripts:$PATH
      before_install:
        - choco install python  --version 3.7 # this install takes at least 1 min 30 sec
        - python --version
        - python -m pip install --upgrade pip

install:
  - ./.travis/install.sh

script:
  - bash -c echo "Tests must go here" # here pytest should go (or any testing program)

before_deploy:
  - ./.travis/build_binaries.sh

deploy:
  provider: releases
  api_key: $RELEASE_TOKEN
  file_glob: true
  file: 
    - dist/kb_*
  skip_cleanup: true
  on:
    tags: true
  name: $TRAVIS_TAG
```

The scripts used to install (install.sh) and deploy (build_binaries.sh).

This is ./.travis/build_binaries.sh
```sh
#!/bin/bash

if [ $TRAVIS_OS_NAME = 'osx' ]; then
  pyinstaller --paths kb/ --onefile kb/__main__.py -n kb_${TRAVIS_TAG}_osx
elif [ $TRAVIS_OS_NAME = 'windows' ]; then
  pyinstaller --paths kb/ --onefile kb/__main__.py -n kb_${TRAVIS_TAG}_win
else
  pyinstaller --paths kb/ --onefile kb/__main__.py -n kb_${TRAVIS_TAG}_linux
fi
```

This is ./.travis/install.sh
```sh
#!/bin/bash

if [ $TRAVIS_OS_NAME = 'osx' ]; then
    pip3 install --upgrade pip
    pip3 install --upgrade setuptools
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    pip3 install .
    pip3 install --upgrade pyinstaller
elif [ $TRAVIS_OS_NAME = 'windows' ]; then
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    python -m pip install --upgrade setuptools
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    python -m pip install .
    python -m pip install --upgrade pyinstaller
else
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install --upgrade setuptools
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install .
    pip install --upgrade pyinstaller
fi
```
