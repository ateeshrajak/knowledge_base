# Nessus Vulnerability Scanner

Suggested installation is through docker:
https://hub.docker.com/r/treadie/nessus/

By doing:

docker run -t --name nessus -p 8834:8834 treadie/nessus


Then we have to register for a home license and get the
activation code that can be inserted in the installation
procedure.

# Guide
Be sure to download the user manual to understand how it works.

Anyway it is pretty easy and straightforward.

We have predefined sets of scans that we can perform and in addition
we can also create our own templates through what is called "Policies".

The basic types of scans are:
- Basic Scan (Just a simple basic network scan)
- Advanced Dynamic Scan (A more advanced network scan)
- Web Application Tests (A web application scan)
