# hashcat
# general syntax:
# hashcat <file_with_hashes> <wordlist(s)> -o <output_results>
# common flags:
# -a - specifies attack mode:
#       0: dictionary
#       3: brute force
# -m - specifies type of hash
# Identify hash with "hash-id" or with online tools such as:
# https://www.tunnelsup.com/hash-analyzer/
# NOTE: For serious cracking, consider using the OneRuleToRuleThemAll
# with the rockyou.txt password list.
# We could also consider using colabcat on the google cloud
# if we don't have physical hardware
