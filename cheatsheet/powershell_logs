# Managing Logs with Powershell

According to the version of Windows installed on the system under
investigation, the number and types of events will differ, so the events
logged by a Windows XP machine may be incompatible with an event log
analysis tool designed for Windows 8.

For example, Event ID 551 on a Windows XP machine refers to a logoff
event; the Windows 7 equivalent is Event ID 4647.

Old Windows events can be converted to new events by adding 4096 to
the Event ID.
