# Notice that depending on how strings is configured
# it may read only the data section or the whole file
# to be sure that we read the whole file use '-a', while
# if we want to read only the data sections use '-d'
# by default strings should be configured with '-a'


# To view strings in a file
strings ./file

# To view strings in a file which are at least 6 chars
strings -n 6 ./file

# To view the offset at which strings are located
# where 'x' means hex, but we can also choose
# 'o' for octal and 'd' for decimal
strings -t x ./file
