# Bug Bounty TomNomNom Methodology

We start from a scope, e.g., *.example.com


# Get the attack surface
assetfinder --subs-only example.com > domains


# Get alive endpoints with relative protocol (http/https)
cat domains | httprobe | tee hosts
cat domains | httprobe | tee -a hosts   ;; this can be used to append to file

# Get URLs
meg -d 1000 -v /
;; or give some paths where the paths are:
meg paths.txt hosts.txt

Here paths.txt may be a file with quickwins :D


# Grep for bounties
grep -Hnri '<regex>' out/

gf ~/.gf/aws-key.json
gf aws-key
