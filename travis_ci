# Travis CI

NOTE: As of 2020 there are two travis-ci, one is travis-ci.org
whose end is planned to be on the end of 2020 and travis-ci.com.
To add a repository to travis-ci.com we should first enable
https://travis-ci.com/account/repositories
and click on "Manage Repositories"
at this point from github we should select the repositories we
want to run within travis-ci.

To go to a specific travis CI page corresponding to a github repo
we can go to the URL:
https://travis-ci.com/github/<githubuser>/<repo_name>

Once our account is activated we should also go to the project
settings in travis CI to set the github token.

Settings on Travis CI are generally found at:
https://travis-ci.com/<user_name>/<repo_name>/settings

We'll use the variable name RELEASE_TOKEN. To get our value, we need to go
to GitHub and add a new token, here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
This will need to just have Repo scope, and doesn't require anything
further. Copy the key provided into the "VALUE" field in Travis. Make
sure you keep "DISPLAY VALUE IN BUILD LOG" unticked to keep the value
out of your logs, and thus not visible to anyone else.
