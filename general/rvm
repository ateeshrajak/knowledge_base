# rvm
## rvm is used to manage rubby versions
## an alternative is rbenv
## Remember that a gemset can be thought of as a set of modules
## For example we could have for ruby version X different gemsets,
## by default there are two gemsets for any ruby version installed:
## -default
## -global
## 
## Remember that the global gemset is the set of packages which are installed in all others gemset
## so when we create a new gemset all the gem installed in the global gemset will be transferred
## to the new created gemset.

# List the installable available versions of ruby
rvm list known

# Install a specific version of Ruby
rvm install 2.3

# View the locally installed versions
rvm list

# Switch to a specific version of ruby for the current session
rvm use 2.2.4 

# List the available and currently selected gemsets for the current version of ruby
rvm gemset list 

# List all the current versions of ruby and gemsets
rvm list gemsets 

# Set the default version of ruby
rvm use --default 1.9.3 

# Show the currently selected version of ruby
rvm current 

# Switch to the default ruby version
rvm default 

# Uninstall and remove the sources of a specific ruby version
rvm remove 2.3 

# Show the available commands
gem help commands

# Install a gem
gem install moduleName

# List the locally installed gems for the current environment
gem list --local


# Search for a package
gem search keyword

# Search for a package using keywords
gem search --details keyword

# Uninstall a module
gem uninstall moduleName

# Search for specific modules using a regex
gem search '^rails$'

# Create a gemset for the currently selected ruby version
rvm gemset create <gemset-name>

# Remove a gemset for the currently selected ruby version
rvm gemset delete <gemset-name>

# Installing a gemset to use for a specific project
The first step involves choosing a version of ruby:
rvm use 2.3 
rvm gemset create my_project_name
rvm gemset list
rvm gemset use my_proj
gem install <packages-we-want>


# Create Project Based Ruby Version and Gemset
## Once we have created a project dir with:
## mkdir my_own_proj; cd my_own_proj
## we can now create two files, which will contain
## correspectively ruby version and ruby gemset name, so we do:
echo "2.3" > .ruby-version
echo "my_own_proj_gemset" > .ruby-gemset
## So that anytime we will cd to the directory we will get the
## an automatic change of ruby version and gemset, this is
## very adviceable for mantaining projects etc...

# Uninstall rvm
rvm implode
