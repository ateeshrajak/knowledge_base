# uuencode/uudecode
## This is a basic utility that is used to encode binary files
## with ASCII text. The mechanism is similar to base64, but
## this type of encoding has a larger set of characters.
## UU stands for Unix-Unix since it was used in the past
## to send binary files.

# Encode a file
uuencode /path/to/inputfile outputfilename > /path/to/outputfile

# Decode a file
uudecode /path/to/encoded/file
