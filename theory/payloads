# Payloads

Staged and Stageless Payloads

Differentiating between Staged and Stageless payloads can be difficult at first, it sounds and seems really complex until you learn the difference between the two. Lets dive into them.

- Staged Payloads require a handler to catch the payload and send the
  appropriate response back to the server to trigger your reverse shell.
- Stageless Payloads do not require any specific handler. A reverse shell
  can be caught with a utility like netcat, socat, or many others.

In metasploit msfvenom the difference between a staged and a stageless
payload can be noticed from the name of the payloads.
For example:

- windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp    (staged)    Spawn a piped command shell, then connect back to the attacker
- windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp    (stageless) Connect back to attacker and spawn a command shell

There is a minor difference between the two, the top payloads is staged
payload (as stated by the description), but, metasploit also has
naming convention. The top payload has three slashes which indicate
it's a staged payload. The bottom payload which is stageless has two
slashes. Additionally, the bottom payload has two underscores, while
the top payload only has one.

Note: All meterpreter payloads will require a handler no matter what.

## Stage vs Stageless, which and where

So far, stageless payloads sound like the best payloads to use for any
given task, right?

Well, no. That's not always the case. Stageless payloads by design are
larger because they contain everything required to land a reverse shell
back on your box in a nice and neat style. This can be a disadvantage
for several reasons (which are reasons that you would want to used a
staged payload for).

There are several reasons you might want to use a staged payload,
for example:

- You could use it when your're limited on space in a SEH Based Buffer
  Overflow, or Stack Based Buffer Overflow;
- You could use it in conjunction with Anti-Virus evasion techniques to
  sleep for a given period of time to escape a sandbox and malware scans
  that might detect your payload. Afterwards, reach out to your Handler
  for the rest of the payload;
- Additionally, you can also use Staged payloads to gain additional
  functionality within your shell (like Meterpreter) and is the biggest
  reason that you would want to use a Staged payload;

Note: Even with some Stageless payloads, to get certain features (like
Meterpreter) to work , you will need a Handler. If you're going to setup
a Handler anyways, you might as well make it a Staged Payload, right?
