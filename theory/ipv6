So what is "IPv6", and why do I need to know about it?

IPv6 or IP version 6 is the next generation Internet protocol which
will eventually replace the current protocol IPv4. IPv6 has a number
of improvements and simplifications when compared to IPv4. The primary
difference is that IPv6 uses 128 bit addresses as compared to the 32 bit
addresses used with IPv4. This means that there are more available IP
addresses using IPv6 than are available with IPv4 alone. For a very clear
comparison, in IPv4 there is a total of 4,294,967,296 IP addresses. With
IPv6, there is a total of 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 IP addresses in a
single /64 allocation.

To also help illustrate the sheer magnitude of available IP addresses
using IPv6, you can get 65536 /64 allocations out of a single /48, and
then 65536 /48 allocations out of a single /32. Many Service Providers
are getting /32 allocations from their Regional Internet Registry (RIR)
like ARIN, APNIC, RIPE, etc.

A significant difference between IPv6 and IPv4 is the address
notation. IPv4 uses a period (.) between each octet, compared to IPv6
which uses a colon (:). With IPv6, if you have a series of zeroes
in a row, the address need not be written out completely. You can
use a double colon (::) to represent that series of zeroes, however
you can only use that once. For example, if you have an address like
"2001:0DB8:0000:0003:0000:01FF:0000:002E", it can be written like
"2001:DB8::3:0:1FF:0:2E" or "2001:DB8:0:3:0:1FF::2E", but would never be
written like "2001:DB8::3::1ff::2E". You also cannot have three colons
in a row (:::).

IPv6 availability depends on your Service Provider, either at home or
for work. In a dual-stack environment, IPv4 and IPv6 co-exist along
the same connection and don't require any special kind of connection. If
dual-stack is not available, you might find yourself using an IP tunneling
product or service to bring IPv6 connectivity to you. Even though IPv4
exhaustion has happened at IANA, IPv4 won't simply disappear off the face
of the Internet, but continued explosive growth requiring more unique
IP address assignments will mean using more and more of the abundant
IPv6 address space.

Many Operating System platforms have native IPv6 support these days. The
UNIX based platforms like Linux, BSD (Free, Open, Net) & MacOSX have had
IPv6 support enabled for years now. Microsoft Windows starting having
native IPv6 support enabled by default with its Vista and Windows 2008
products. Earlier Windows versions like 2000/2003/XP had to have it
installed optionally, and did not have as robust features that are
available in the newer versions of Windows. Even common web browsing
and email software will use IPv6 if it is enabled and available, without
having to check off an option or special configuration. The transition
from IPv4 to IPv6 is being worked on to be as seamless as possible,
and many might not even notice the subtle changes in the coming years.
