# AUR
AUR is the Arch User Repository and is a community oriented repository
for Arch and Arch-based distros.

To create a package for AUR, we need two files:
1. PKGBUILD, that is a description of how the file has to be downloaded,
             built, installed and other metadata related to it
2. .SRCINFO, contains the useful metadata for the AUR repository generated
             from the PKGBUILD file
             
It is useful to check out other PKGBUILD or the official guide
to understand what are the steps to perform when writing
a PKGBUILD file.

Once we have a PKGBUILD file we can generate our .SCRINFO by doing:

    makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO

Once we have a PKGBUILD file we can try it by doing:

    mkdir /tmp/mypkg/; mv PKGBUILD /tmp/mypkg; cd /tmp/mypkg
    makepkg --syncdeps

This built the package, then to install it we can do:

    makepkg --install

To clean up leftover files and folders we can do:

    makepkg --clean


## Packetize python projects
A useful project I found to automatically build PKGBUILD
from packages uploaded to pypi is:
https://pypi.org/project/pip2pkgbuild/

We can simply do:

    pip2pkgbuild <name_of_the_existing_pypi_pkg> -p python -b <name_of_the_aur_pkg>

This approach is fine, if we want to import into AUR a stable version
of a package that is already present within the pypi.

But in the case we want to build a git-synchronized package (e.g., nameofmypackage-git)
we can build a PKGBUILD from the template of kb or pdlist.
Indeed these ones need a dynamic version string to be able to keep up
with git commits/push.


## Upload to AUR

Once we have uploaded an SSH public key on our AUR account
we can:

    git clone ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/<name-of-the-package>.git

Don't worry if you think that you are cloning a non-existing
repo, since it will be created as soon as you clone.

Note that the name of the package can also be ending with -git
if we are building it from a git repo (e.g., bleeding-edge version)

    cd <name-of-the-package>
    cp /path/to/PKGBUILD .
    cp /path/to/.SRCINFO .
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial push to AUR"
    git push
