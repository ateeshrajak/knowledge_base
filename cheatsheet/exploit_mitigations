# Exploit Mitigations

The most common security mitigations are:
- ASLR           (Address Space Layout Randomization)
- Stack Canaries
- PIE            (Position Independent Executable)
- NX/DEP         (Data Execution Prevention)


# ASLR
This allows the randomization of addresses used by a program
at runtime.

## Disable ASLR
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space


# Stack Canaries
This is a protection on the return address string in functions.
They prevent overwriting return addresses.

## Disable Stack Canaries
gcc ... -fno-stack-protector ...

# PIE

This gives an offset to the addresses used by the program.

## Disable PIE
gcc ... -no-pie ...

# NX/DEP

This allows to not execute code from the stack.

## Disable NX/DEP
gcc ... -z execstack ...
