# SOCKS

SOCKS is an Internet protocol that exchanges network packets between
a client and server through a proxy server. SOCKS5 optionally provides
authentication so only authorized users may access a server. Practically,
a SOCKS server proxies TCP connections to an arbitrary IP address, and
provides a means for UDP packets to be forwarded.  Basically the SOCKS
protocols are used to build proxies. There are three main versions:
SOCKS4, SOCKS4a and SOCKS5.
SOCKS is the abbreviation of "SOCKetS" and its advantage is the ease
of implementation and the flexible independence from the application
layer protocol.

The SOCKS5 protocol is defined in RFC 1928. It is an incompatible
extension of the SOCKS4 protocol; it offers more choices for
authentication and adds support for IPv6 and UDP, the latter of which can
be used for DNS lookups.
