# John The Ripper Rules

We can decide how john the ripper modifies our wordlist by using rules.
There are predefined rules in the john the ripper (jumbo patch) but we
can also create our own rules.

## List installed rules
john --list=rules

## Use a rule
;; we can use the --stdout to check out the list generated by john
john --rules=single  --wordlist=rockyou10.txt --stdout
