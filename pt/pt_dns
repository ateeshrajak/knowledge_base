### DNS service enumeration


```sh
whois domain.com
dig {a|txt|ns|mx} domain.com
dig {a|txt|ns|mx} domain.com @ns1.domain.com
host -t {a|txt|ns|mx} domain.com
host -a domain.com
host -l domain.com ns1.domain.com
for sub in $(cat subdomains.txt);do host $sub.domain.com|grep "has.address";done
```

If we find that a DNS server (tcp) is listening on the host we can try to
enumerate starting from that nameserver by doing:
```sh
nsloookup
SERVER <ip_address_of_nameserver>
127.0.0.1 # we try to resolve 127.0.0.1, sometimes a hostname may be leaked
<ip_address_of_nameserver> # sometimes this leaks other hostnames
# keep into account that reverse lookups may not be enabled
<hostname_of_machine> # we can double check the ip address of the machine if we
# know its hostname
```

Another thing we can do to perform enumeration on DNS servers is:
```sh
dnsrecon -r 127.0.0.0/24 -n <ip_address_of_nameserver>
dnsrecon -r 127.0.1.0/24 -n <ip_address_of_nameserver>
# both these commands are used to check if there are other hosts on the nameserver machine
```
We may also attempt to find domain names belonging to the same LAN network in
which the nameserver resides, and this can be done by providing LAN addresses to
tools such as dnsrecon like this:
```sh
dnsrecon -r 10.0.0.0/8 -n <ip_address_of_nameserver> --db database.db
dnsrecon -r 172.16.0.0/12 -n <ip_address_of_nameserver> --db database.db
dnsrecon -r 192.168.0.0/16 -n <ip_address_of_nameserver> --db database.db
```

We can also attempt to perform zone transfers.

Windows DNS zone transfer
```sh
nslookup
set type=any
ls -d blah.com
```

Linux DNS zone transfer:
```sh
# We can attempt a zone transfer from the root zone in this way:
dig axfr @<ip_address_of_nameserver>
# or
dig axfr @ns1.blah.com # so by putting the hostname
```

Many times zone transfers are not enabled from the root zone, so we must have
more specific and try to perform zone transfer from a specific zone, this can be
done in this way:
```sh
dig axfr example.com @ns1.blah.com
# where in this case example.com is the zone from where we are attempting the 
# zone transfer
```

Notice that some older/misconfigured versions of bind show their version number
when askekd for. We can request the version number by doing:
```sh
dig -t txt -c chaos VERSION.BIND @<dns_server_ip_or_hostname>
# remember that to find the DNS server of a domain we have to obtain its NS
# records, so we can do that by doing dig -t NS <domainname.com>
```
