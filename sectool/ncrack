# ncrack
## Common flags list: 
## -v verbose
## -vv very verbose
## -u specifies a single user
## -U specifies a list of users in a file 
## --pass specifies a single password
## -P specifies a list of password in a file 
## -f stops after the first valid found credentials
## -T [0~5] specifies how aggressive the bruteforce will be: 0 (paranoid), 5 (insane) # 0 and 1 are for IDS evasion
## -d enables debugging, it is a more powerful verbose
## -sL lists only hosts and services
## -iL specifies a list of hosts 
## -iX specifies as input the nmap output XML file obtained with nmap -oX
## -iN specifies as input the nmap output normal file obtained with nmap -oN
## -oA outputs the results of ncrack
## Good password lists to use are:
## - better default pass from SecLists (for common protocols/apps)
## - 10_million_password_list_top_1000.txt 
## - ...
## - rockyou (this is too much in general for e.g., ssh)

# Search /ServicesTable/ in man page to list supported services

# Common fine-tuning bruteforce options:
 cl (min connection limit) - minimum number of concurrent parallel connections
 CL (max connection limit) - maximum number of concurrent parallel connections
 at (authentication tries) - authentication attempts per connection
 cd (connection delay) - delay time between each connection initiation
 cr (connection retries) - caps number of service connection attempts
 to (time-out) - maximum cracking time for service, regardless of success so far

# Common in-running commands
 v increase verbosity level
 V decrease verbosity level
 d increase debugging level
 D decrease debugging level
 p / P display found credentials
 ? print a runtime interaction help screen

# Bruteforce with password "admin123" and a users list
ncrack -U users.txt --pass admin123 10.10.10.10:21

# Bruteforce with users and passwords list. The XML is an nmap input, ncrack will follow it

# Aggressive bruteforce, with user "test" and a passwords list
ncrack -u test -P 500-worst-passwords.txt -T 5 -p 21 10.10.10.10

# RDP bruteforce attempt on port 3389, with user "administrator" and a passwords list
ncrack -u administrator -P 500-worst-passwords.txt -p 3389 10.212.50.21

# Very verbose bruteforce with users, passwords and host lists, outputs the results
ncrack -vv -U users.txt -P passwords.txt -iL host.txt -oA output_ncrack
