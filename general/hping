# hping
# Commmon flags:
# - `-c`: number of packets to send
# - `-1`: ICMP
# - `-2`: UDP
# - `-V`: Verbose
# - `-z`: connects ctrl+z on the keyboard to increase TTL
# - `-p`: destination port
# - `-s`: source port
# Note that as response we can typically encounter the following flags:
# - SA (syn/ack), this is the response for an open port generally
# - RA (rst/ack), this is the response for a closed port generally

# To use ICMP (-1 mode) ping
hping3 -1 example.com

# To use ICMP (-1 mode) with type 17
# triggers a remote system to respond with a list of its related subnets,
hping -1 192.168.1.1 -C 17

# Check if ICMP is disabled on a specific network
hping3 -1 192.168.1.x --rand-dest -I wlan0

# Traceroute with ICMP
# If hping gets stuck on any given hop simple press ctrl-z in order to
# skip unresponsive hop
hping3 -1 --traceroute -V www.example.com

# Traceroute with UDP
hping3 -2 4.2.2.1 -p ++44444 -T -n

# Traceroute with TCP
hping3 --traceroute -V -S -p 93 -s 5678 example.com

# Traceroute with TCP (to check how many different paths are taken at hop 15)
hping3 -S 1.1.1.1 -p 80 -T --ttl 15 --tr-keep-ttl -n

# Traceroute with TCP and ctrl+z to increase TTL manually
hping3 -z -t 1 -S google.com -p 80

# Check firewall rules with portquiz.net

# Port scan with SYN
hping3 -V -S -p 93 -s 5678 example.com

# Port scan with TCP timestamp (some firewalls drop packets with no timestamp)

# Port scan with UDP
hping3 -2 192.168.1.6 -p 56 -c 1

# ACK scan
# Results:
# - the target is **down** if no reply is received
# - the target is **alive** if a packet with RST flag set is received
hping3 -c 1 -V -p 93 -s 5678 -A dominio.xyz

# FIN scan
# Results:
# - the target port is **open** if no reply is received
# - the target port is **closed** if an RST+ACK is received
# Notice that Windows, Cisco, HP-UX and IRIX do not follow the RFC and
# send RST to make FIN scan ineffective
hping -c 1 -V -p 80 -s 5050 -F example.com

# NULL scan
# Results:
# - the target port is **closed** if an RST is received 
# - the target port is **open** or **filtered** if no reply is received

# Firewall Rule Testing
# Let's set up the scene, let's say we are inside a network and we want
# to understand what is firewalled, what we would ideally need is an
# external IP which does not have any specific firewall rules on, such as
# our trusted VPS. As an example we will show how to test if port 80 is
# filtered, but we should do it for any port we want to test.
# Check if port 80 is blocked
hping3 -S <vps_ip> -c 4 -p 80

# We can also use some online services such as portquiz which keeps all
# TCP ports open for us, let's see an example:
hping3 -S portquiz.net -c 4 -p 80

# Firewalk 
# This is an active reconnaissance network security technique that attempts
# to determine what layer 4 protocols a given IP forwarding device will
# pass. Firewalk works by sending out TCP or UDP packets with a TTL one
# greater than the targeted gateway. If the gateway allows the traffic,
# it will forward the packets to the next hop where they will expire and
# elicit an ICMP_TIME_EXCEEDED message. If the gateway hostdoes not allow
# the traffic, it will likely drop the packets on the floor and we will
# see no response. (Also in this case we may use portquiz.net)
hping3 -z -t 1 -S <vps_ip> -p 80
