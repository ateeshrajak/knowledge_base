We may use hashcat to crack passwords faster by using available GPUs, but first
we have to convert the `.cap` file to a file compatible with hashcat, and this
can be done, either online or with hashcat-utils, by doing:

```sh
cap2hccapx capture.cap capturefile.hccapx
```

```sh
hashcat -I 
# this will show available platforms, be sure to have installed all required
# dependencies such as opencl and so on
```

To check available formats we can do:
```sh
hashcat --help
```

From here we can see that WPA/WPA2 is the option "2500", so we can do:
```sh
hashcat -m 2500 -d 1 capturefile.hccapx wordlist.txt
# with -m 2500 we choose to crack WPA/WPA2 hashes
# with -d 1 we select the first device in the device list shown with
# `hashcat -I`
# capturefile.hccapx is the hasshcat compatible file with hashes
# wordlist.txt is the wordlist file
```
