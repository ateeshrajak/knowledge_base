# Exploit Hex Analysis

## Why is this buffer there and what does it mean?

Unless we understand assembly language, reverse engineering and binary
file analysis, there is not much that we can do other than to test the
exploit in a test environment.

But we can still try to analyze a shellcode using the following tricks.

## See if there are any printable / ASCII characters
echo -en "\x7f\x45\x4c\x46\x01....." | xxd

# See if it matches any known file type
echo -en "\x7f\x45\x4c\x46\x01....." | file -s -

# Find whether it contains any known file types (also inside):
echo -en "\x7f\x45\x4c\x46\x01....." > blob.bin
binwalk blob.bin

# Interpret the blob as machine code (instructions) and read the assembly code:
echo -en "\x7f\x45\x4c\x46\x01....." | ndisasm -u -
