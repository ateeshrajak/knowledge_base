# There are many software out there who allow us to generate password lists, one
# that I found particularly smart (using regexes) is `exrex` written in python.
# [exrex](https://github.com/asciimoo/exrex)

# Generate three passwords 'a', 'b', 'c'
exrex '[abc]' 

# Generate all the combinations of 'a', 'b', 'c' with exactly 3 characters
exrex '[abc]{3}' 

# Generate all the combinations of 'a', 'b','c' from 1 character to 3 characters
exrex '[abc]{1,3}' 

# Generate passwords from 'company2011' to 'company2019'
exrex '(company)(201)[1-9]' 

# Other examples
exrex '(password|secret)[1-3]'
exrex '(Spring|Winter|Autumn|Fall|Summer|Winter)(20)?1[456789]'
