# size
## This program shows the size of the runtime image of an object/executable
## which is not directly related to the size of the file (bss uses no bytes
## in the file no matter how large, the file may contain debugging information
## that is not part of the runtime image, etc.)
## Other kinds of info on size can be gathered by using:
## - ls -> show size of the file (when you open and read it, that's how many bytes you will get)
## - du -> shows actual disk usage which can be smaller than the file size due to holes


# To get size of different sections of an executable
size <filename>
