## Getting info from ARP
With ARP, we can get info on what kind of devices
are sending data, if there is some MAC address that
we cannot resolve, this is suspicious from a DFIR
point of view.

ARP is also useful to check which MAC address to
IP address association. In this context ARP broadcast
requests are particularly useful, since in these requests
we can find where the sender, in case no response
is received, gets the address.


## Getting info from ICMP
Suspicious packets here are the ones with uncommon
opcodes (opcodes different from 8 and 0).
