# Azure AD

Recently there has been a shift in Active Directory pushing the companies
to cloud networks for their companies. The most notable AD cloud provider
is Azure AD. Its default settings are much more secure than an on-premise
physical Active Directory network; however, the cloud AD may still have
vulnerabilities in it.

# Azure AD Overview

acts as the middle man between your physical Active Directory and your
users' sign on. This allows for a more secure transaction between domains,
making a lot of Active Directory attacks ineffective.

## Cloud Security Overview

The best way to show you how the cloud takes security precautions
past what is already provided with a physical network is to show you a
comparison with a cloud Active Directory environment:


Windows Server AD   | Azure AD
--------------------------------------
LDAP                | Rest APIs
NTLM                | OAuth/SAML
Kerberos            | OpenID
OU Tree             | Flat Structure
Domains and Forests | Tenants
Trusts              | Guests


This is only an overview of Active Directory in the cloud so we will not
be going into detail of any of these protocols; however, I encourage
you to go out and do your own research into these cloud protocols and
how they are more secure than their physical counterparts, and if they
themselves come with vulnerabilities.
