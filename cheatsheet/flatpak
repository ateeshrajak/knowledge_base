## System vs User Installations
Flatpak commands can be run either system-wide or per-user.
Flatpak commands are run system-wide by default. 
If you are installing applications for day-to-day usage, 
it is recommended to stick with this default behavior.
However, running commands per-user can be useful for testing and
development purposes, since objects that are installed in this way wonâ€™t
be available to other users on the system. To do this, use the `--user`
option, which can be used in combination with most flatpak commands.
