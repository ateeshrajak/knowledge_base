# creddump

;; creddump is composed by three main tools:
;; - cachedump
;; - lsadump
;; - pwdump

;; We can generally dump passwords if we have the following files:
;; - SAM
;; - SYSTEM
;; - SECURITY
;; these files correspond to different hives in the Windows registry.

## cachedump
cachedump <system hive> <security hive>

## lsadump
lsadump <system hive> <security hive>

# pwdump
pwdump <system hive> <SAM hive>



NOTE: on Windows10 v1607 and later you might need pwdump8.exe
by Fulvio Zanetti and Andrea Petralia, supporting AES128 encrypted hashes.

I am only able to run pwdump8.exe from a Linux wine command as follows:
wine "c:\pwdump8.exe" -f SYSTEM SAM
