# You can't directly install packages from the Arch User Database (AUR) with pacman.
# You need yaourt/yay to perform that. But considering yaourt itself is in the AUR, here is how to build a package from its tarball.
# Installing a package from AUR is a relatively simple process:
# - Retrieve the archive corresponding to your package from AUR website
# - Extract the archive (preferably in a folder for this purpose)
# - Run makepkg in the extracted directory. (makepkg-s allows you to install any dependencies automatically from deposits.)
# - Install the package created using pacman
# Assuming $pkgname contains the package name.
wget "https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/${pkgname::2}/$pkgname/$pkgname.tar.gz"
tar zxvf "$pkgname.tar.gz"
cd "$pkgname"
# Build the package
makepkg -s
# Install
sudo pacman -U <package file (.pkg.tar.xz)>
