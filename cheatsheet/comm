# comm
## By default, comm outputs 3 columns: left-only, right-only, both. The -1,
## -2 and -3 switches suppress these columns.
## So, -23 hides the right-only and both columns, showing the lines that
## appear only in the first (left) file.
## If you want to find lines that appear in both, you can use -12, which
## hides the left-only and right-only columns, leaving you with just the
## both column.

# Show lines contained in file1 which are not in file2
comm -23 <(sort -u file1) <(sort -u file2)

# Show lines contained in file2 which are not in file1
comm -13  <(sort -u file1) <(sort -u file2)
or simply
comm -23 <(sort -u file2) <(sort -u file1)

# Show lines contained in both files
comm -12 <(sort -u file1) <(sort -u file2)
