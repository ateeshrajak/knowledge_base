# Pentesting Drupal Web Applications

# Enumeration (droopescan)
droopescan scan -u <URL>

# Username Enumeration
In /user/register just try to create a username and if the name is already taken it will be notified :
*The name admin is already taken*

If you request a new password for an existing username :
*Unable to send e-mail. Contact the site administrator if the problem persists.*

If you request a new password for a non-existent username :
*Sorry, test is not recognized as a user name or an e-mail address.*

Accessing /user/<number> you can see the number of existing users :
    - /user/1 -> Access denied (user exist)
    - /user/2 -> Page not found (user doesn't exist)

# Hidden Pages Enumeration

Fuzz /node/<NUMBER> where <NUMBER> is a number (from 1 to 500 for
example).  You could find hidden pages (test, dev) which are not
referenced by the search engines.

    wfuzz -c -z range,1-500 --hc 404 <URL>/node/FUZZ

# RCE Through Panel

You need the plugin php to be installed (check it accessing to
/modules/php and if it returns a 403 then, exists, if not found, then
the plugin php isn't installed)

Go to Modules -> (Check) PHP Filter  -> Save configuration
