# scrapy
# Please take a look at xpath for checking how to properly write queries

# Launch a scrapy shell on a URL
scrapy shell "http://vulnhub.com/timeline"
;; from now on we can extract stuff from the response object
;; either using CSS selectors or XPath, I prefer XPath


# Extract all links ("a" fields)
response.xpath("//a").extract()
;; or
response.xpath("//a").getall()
