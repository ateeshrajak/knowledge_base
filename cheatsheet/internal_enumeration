# Enumeration

Start with a wireshark/tcpdump scan and check out how the others are
characterized, so what hardware a corporate is using and what kind of
hostnames are in use.  We should be able to build our camouflage by
changing MAC addresses and hostnames.

Once we have access on a machine we can also enumerate with
ARP, for example there is a comfortable arp scanner on metasploit:

    windows/gather/arp_scanner

We should also run avahi passively to get all the data about
services running on a network passively.
A cool thing to do is:

    avahi-browse
