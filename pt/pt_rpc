# RPC Bind enumeration is possible when RPC ports are exposed
# most likely we can see this happen on port 111 (which may also indicate
# the presence of an NFS server) or on port 135 on Microsoft Windows
# systems.

# Get Information with IP address
rpcinfo -p IP
OR 
rcpclient -U "" IP
OR
enum4linux -a $IP


# Port 135 TCP is used in general for remote inter-process communication,
# where some processes can publish some functions and other
# processes can call those functions.
# It is remote, since this makes it possible to interact from
# different machines.

# In particular port 135 TCP works as service mapper, so that
# we can query the system to understand which services are running
# on that host.

# We can use enum4linux to get some information, such as
# operating system info:
```sh
enum4linux -o <ip-address>
```
# If we have username/password we could get much more information.

# We can also use a very useful metasploit module:
`auxiliary/scanner/dcerpc/endpoint_mapper` 
# to get a lot of information on the RPC interface.
