# Powershell Empire
Generally Empire nowadays is installed with a GUI
called "starkiller".

Powershell has different components:
- Listeners: listeners will listen on a specific port similar to netcat or msf multi/handler;
- Stagers: these will send off an agent which is similar to a payload;
- Agents: these are the payloads, and this is where the majority of the interaction happens;
- Modules: these are specific tools and exploits that can be used with agents like enumeration
          scripts, privilege escalation tools and so on;
- Credentials: here we can manage any enumerated credentials found from a device or module;
- Reporting: this allows us to see shell commands and modules we have run in the past;


## Install
git clone https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/
cd Empire/
./setup/install.sh

## Launch Empire with REST interface
;; By using --rest with Empire we start the server as a rest API, which allows us to connect Empire with Starkiller
./empire --rest
