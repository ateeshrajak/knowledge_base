# FTP Protocol
Default Port:21 and 20
RFC: https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc959.txt (RFC959)

The FTP server may support either Active or Passive connections, or both. 

- In an Active FTP connection, the client opens a port and listens. The
  server is required to actively connect to it;
- In a Passive FTP connection, the server opens a port and listens
  (passively) and the client connects to it;


This separation of command information and data into separate channels
is a way of being able to send commands to the server without having
to wait for the current data transfer to finish. If both channels were
interlinked, you could only enter commands in between data transfers,
which wouldn't be efficient for either large file transfers, or slow
internet connections.
