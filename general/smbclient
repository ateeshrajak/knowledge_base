## Once inside an smbclient connection
## we should remember to set:
## `recurse on`: to allow dealing with directories
## `prompt off`: to disable asking confirmation for each file operation


# To display public shares on the server
smbclient -L '\\192.168.1.220'

smbclient //<host>/<share> -U<user>%<password>
