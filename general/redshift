# redshift
#
# redshift sets colors according to Temperature values,
# as it happens with lamps. The value must be between 1000K and 25000K.

# Remember that when setting colors manually we must be sure that
# no redshift application is running (e.g., redshift-gtk)

# Manually set colors to the specified temperature color
redshift -P -O 2700k    ;; 2700k is a sort of night mode

# Reset settings
redshift -x

# Automatically manage color shifting
redshift-gtk
