# Pentesting NNTP Network News Transfer Protocol

Here we can do basic information gathering by issuing
the following commands:


CAPABILITIES [keyword] allows a client to determine the capabilities of the server at any given time.

MODE READER

QUIT  to disconnect the session

LISTGROUP [group [range]] : The LISTGROUP command selects a newsgroup
     in the same manner as the GROUP command (see Section 6.1.1) but also
     provides a list of article numbers in the newsgroup. If no group is
     specified, the currently selected newsgroup is used.


ARTICLE message-id The ARTICLE command selects an article according to
     the arguments and presents the entire article (that is, the headers,
     an empty line, and the body, in that order) to the client

POST    post an article

Example

[Client] POST
[Server] 340 Input article; end with <CR-LF>.<CR-LF>
[Client] From: "Demo User" <nobody@example.net>
[Client] Newsgroups: misc.test
[Client] Subject: I am just a test article
[Client] Organization: An Example Net
