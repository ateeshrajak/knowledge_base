- Stereotyped challenges
    Hackers tend to have stereotypes about wargames; Many consider
    wargames as basic learning materials for new-comers of cyber
    security. Well, it’s not completely true. I personally think
    wargames are supposed to be and meant to be very challenging,
    regardless of how they’re good at it. So, here it is. This wargame
    is a little bit different to break your typical stereotypes. This
    wargame is intended for offensive security experts who are willing
    to overcome situations of getting stuck in breaking into web services
    or web-based solutions.

    starting from the simple Caesar cipher all the way to modern AES we
    have challenges for everyone. Our challenges range from level I to III,
    and an additional level X for “mystery” challenges (they may have
    been unsolved for a long time, mostly we don’t know their solution or
    have no idea whether there is a solution at all). If you are a beginner

    Similar to the original flAWS.cloud (also created by Summit Route), this
    game/tutorial teaches you AWS (Amazon Web Services) security concepts. The
    challenges are focused on AWS specific issues, so no buffer overflows,
