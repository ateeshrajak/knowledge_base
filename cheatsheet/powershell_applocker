# Managing AppLocker with Powershell

AppLocker can allow or block applications based on three types of
criteria. Files can be grouped by their path, their publisher, or their
hash. As the Windows AppLocker Guide points out, individual rules should
be built in this order and for these reasons:

- Publisher: Uses the least amount of administrative work and is the most flexible.
- Hash: More secure than a path rule, inflexible when a program updates.
- Path: Least desirable. Path locations should not allow standard users to have write access. 

# Get All applocker related comamnds
Get-Command -Module AppLocker 


# Get Information about a file in order to apply an AppLocker policy
Get-AppLockerFileInformation -Path C:\my\path\to\file.exe | Format-List
;; this will show, publisher of the file, its hash and its path
;; so that we can easily grab these as information for applying our
;; applocker rule

# Get Applied Domain AppLocker Policies
Get-AppLockerPolicy -Domain

# Get Applied Local AppLocker Policies
Get-AppLockerPolicy -Local

# Get Applied and Effective AppLocker Policies
Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective

# Create a new AppLocker Policy
Get-AppLockerFileInformation -Path C:\path\to\file.exe | New-AppLockerPolicy -RuleType Publisher,Hash -User Everyone -RuleNamePrefix "myEXE"

# Test an AppLocker Policy
;; Test-AppLockerPolicy: This cmdlet is used to determine whether or not a
;; specific user or group of users will be able to perform an action based
;; on the policy
Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective | Test-AppLockerPolicya -Path C:\Path\to\my\file.exe -User Everyone
