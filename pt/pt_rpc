# PT RPC
## most likely we can see this happen on port 111 (which may also indicate
## the presence of an NFS server) or on port 135 on Microsoft Windows
## systems.
## Port 135 TCP is used in general for remote inter-process communication,
## where some processes can publish some functions and other
## processes can call those functions.
## It is remote, since this makes it possible to interact from
## different machines.

## In particular port 135 TCP works as service mapper, so that
## we can query the system to understand which services are running
## on that host.


# Nmap Scan
nmap -n -v -sV -Pn -p 135 --script=msrpc-enum 192.168.1.10 

# If vulnerable
msf > use exploit/windows/dcerpc/ms03_026_dcom

# We can also use a very useful metasploit module:
`auxiliary/scanner/dcerpc/endpoint_mapper` 
# to get a lot of information on the RPC interface.


# Get Information with IP address
rpcinfo $IP

# Connect to the RPC console
rpcclient -U "" $IP
or 
rpcclient -U "" $IP
or
rpcclient -U "DOMAINNAME.LOCAL\username" 10.10.10.175

# Commands within RPC console
srvinfo

# Get the list of users in the domain
enumdomusers

# Get the list of groups in the domain
enumdomgroups

# Get the list of users within a group (0x200 are the domain admins)
## Here users are shown in the form:
## rid:[0x451] attr:[0x7]
## rid:[0x1f4] attr:[0x7]
## We have to convert these numbers, e.g., RID 1F4 (= 500) is the Administrator
querygroupmem 0x200

# Get Information about IP Address
enum4linux -a $IP


# We can use enum4linux to get some information, such as
# operating system info:
enum4linux -o <ip-address>

# If we have username/password we could get much more information.


# RPC on port 111
rpcinfo -p 192.168.1.111
